# PGE-receptor-model
ODE-based model describing the influence of several PGE-receptors on the PKA-pathway in platelets

Prostaglandins are the key-players in diminishing platelet function. They exert their effects via a variety of surface receptors that are linked to the cAMP/PKA-signalling cascade. However, less is known about the quantitative impact of the individual receptors on the underlying pathway. We present here a comprehensive ordinary differential equation-based model of the platelet cAMP pathway, including the four prostaglandin receptors IP, DP1, EP3 and EP4, the ADP receptor P2Y12, a detailed PKA-module as well as downstream-targets. Parameter estimation along with a comprehensive combination of time-course and dose-response measurements revealed the individual quantitative role of each receptor in elevating or decreasing pathway activity. A comparison of the two inhibiting receptors EP3 and P2Y12 exhibited a greater signalling strength of the EP3 receptor with implications for antithrombotic treatment. Furthermore, analysis of different model topologies revealed a direct influence of PKA on adenylate cyclase, reducing its maximum catalytic speed. Finally, we show here for the first time the dynamic behaviour of VASP-phosphorylation, which is commonly used as a marker for platelet-inhibition. We validate our model by comparing it to further experimental data.
